# The old man and the sea


Author: [Ernest Miller Hemingway][]


This is my third time to read this novel, which still impressed me a lot.
The sentence "A man can be destroyed but not defeated" has been accompanying me since the first time I read it, which should be traced back to primary schools.

This time, it only took me 2 to 3 days to finish reading.
During this time period, I enjoyed the most famous fishing fight again.

Among the lots of different explanations about this story, I think I prefer the fighting spirit explanation.
Although Santiago got nothing for his battle with a large marlin, he shows us what a real man should be and what a real battle is.

This story is simply but meaningful.

Maybe one day I will it for the forth time.

# 深度学习的艺术


Author: 采铜

This book talks about how to learn knowledge.

In this book, the author split the learning process into 4 parts:

1. Questioning
2. Decoding
3. Practising
4. Fusion

Basically, I agree with this categorization. 
But, in this way, I have to think about a lot of things while I am reading some materials.
I may need more practise to get used to this categorization.

Another idea that this book attracts me is that, we need to get the knowledge actively instead of receiving knowledge passively.
In most cases, we think we are learning knowledge, but actually we are receiving knowledge passively.
More specifically, when we set up a target: "I will finish reading this chapter today", it is only about reading through the materials, not learning.

# 小强升职记


Author: [邹鑫][]

A lot of time management methods are talked about in this book.

As a matter of fact, I have heard about this book for a long time, but never read it carefully until now.
It provides a lot useful advice to improve your work efficiency.
All of these advice is dependent on the GTD, which is a working method that is designed for business man to work more efficiently.
