# Morphology

Morphology is concerned with the construction of words and the meaning of their components.

A morpheme is the smallest meaning-bearing unit of a word.

Words are composed of stems and affixes.

Affixes consist of:

- prefixes\*
- suffixes\*
- infixes
- circumfixes

More than one prefixes and suffixes.

# Inflectional vs Derivational

- Inflectional: variants that have essentially the same meanning and the same genral pos tag.
- Derivational: 

We can not stripping affixes blindly.

Trust Dictionary.

# Stemming

Most stemmer just chop off common prefixes and suffixes, which may not be a real word.
