# The Telomere Effect

Genes load the gun, ann environment pulls the trigger.

细胞的分裂次数是固定的，

Stem cells have enough telomerase to enable them to keep divding through out our life spans.

Focus people have longer telomeres.

老年细胞: prematurely age cell

细胞总是在不停地renew

stem cell: have the ability to become different types of specialized cells.

Aging can be defined as the cell's "progressive functional impairment and reduced capacity to repond appropriately to environmental stimuli and injurires."


Telomerase can slow, prevent or even reverse the shortening of telomeres that comes with cell division.
However, as we age, the telomerase is most of our cells generally becomes less active, and telomeres get shorter.

Too much telomerase in the wrong cells at the wrong time, cells will not stop dividing, these cells are called "cancer".

The keh is to well regulate the action of telomerase on telomeres--in the right cell and at the right times, because only that will keep telomeres and us healthy.

More stress  ==> Shorter telomeres and lower telomerase levels.

Lifestyle changes can have an effect on telomere maintenance as soon as 3 weeks to four months.
